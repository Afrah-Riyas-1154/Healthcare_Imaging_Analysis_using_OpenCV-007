Description:
This project implements a Healthcare Imaging Analysis System using OpenCV. The system is designed to detect and highlight potential abnormalities in medical images such as X-rays using basic image processing techniques.

The system converts the input image to grayscale, applies Gaussian blurring to reduce noise, and uses thresholding to segment high-intensity regions that may represent abnormalities. It then detects contours and draws bounding boxes around suspicious areas, helping in the visual localization of possible issues like fractures, tumors, or lesions.

Key functionalities include:
Uploading and analyzing medical images (e.g., X-ray scans).

Preprocessing the image using grayscale conversion and Gaussian blur.

Applying thresholding and contour detection to isolate abnormal regions.

Drawing bounding boxes to highlight detected abnormalities.

The project was developed as part of the Naan Mudhalvan Training Program and demonstrates a practical application of computer vision in the healthcare domain for early-stage analysis and detection.
